        <h1>My projects</h1>


        <p>These are the projects I have worked on so far.</p>
        <h2 class = "cyan">Website - Pasta Vino</h2>
        <p>Making a website for a customer: Our assignment was to make a website for a customer, our customer was a pizzaria.</p>
        <h2 class = "cyan">3D animation - S.O.S. Kinderdorpen</h2>
        <p>Creating 3D animation in Blender: We had to make an animation in Blender, which is tool often used to make professional animations. This time it was for the foundation "SOS Kinderdorpen".  </p>
        <h2 class = "cyan">Data visualisation - Gemeente Rotterdam</h2>
        <p>Data visualisation: In "Javascript" we had to make a dashboard of all the data of stolen bikes in Rotterdam, so the police could easily look through all the data that they needed. </p>
        <h2 class = "cyan">Website - Philips lamps </h2>
        <p>Philips lamps: We made a website in "Javascript". With that website you could control the Philips lamps. What the lamps should do was your own idea. Our idea was to make a website for autistic children who could express their feelings by using the colors of the lamps.</p>
        <h2 class = "cyan">Game - IBM </h2>
        <p>The company IBM gave us the assignment to make a retro game. Our idea was to recreate the DINO-WIFI game. Ofcourse we had our own input, so we made a cookie monster game.</p>
